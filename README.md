# corelogic

to do list:
- create generalized "run_model.py" script that can be adapted to any config file so we don't need separate scripts for each model
- archive old scripts
- create "modeling" class with alternatives to random forest (some flavor of linear model, XGBoost, LightGBM)
- create "evaluation" class with methods to generate mean ratios, weighted mean ratios, COD, PRB, PRD
